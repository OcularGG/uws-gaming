### Partially Working
- ⚠️ Email sending for password reset (requires SMTP configuration)

### SMTP Configuration
- SMTP settings added to .env.local but need real credentials
- For testing, you can configure with:
  - Gmail SMTP
  - Mailgun
  - SendGrid
  - Or any other SMTP provider

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test Login Functionality**
   - Try logging in with admin credentials
   - Try logging in with user credentials
   - Verify session persistence

2. **Test Password Reset** (Optional)
   - Configure real SMTP credentials
   - Test forgot password flow
   - Verify reset tokens work

3. **Production Considerations**
   - Move password reset tokens to database or Redis
   - Configure production SMTP
   - Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Add email verification for new accounts

## 🏴‍☠️ AUTHENTICATION READY!

The authentication system is fully functional and ready for testing. Both admin and user accounts are seeded and ready to use. The pirate-themed naval battle signup application can now authenticate users properly.

**Ready to test login at**: http://localhost:3002/auth/login
