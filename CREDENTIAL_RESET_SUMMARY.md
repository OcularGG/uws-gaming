- `database-url-prod` - Created/updated for deployment scripts
- `uws-gaming-db-password` - Updated with new password

#### Environment Files
- `.env.local` - Created for local development with public IP connection
- `.env.production` - Updated with new Cloud SQL Proxy connection

#### Database URLs
- **Production**: `postgresql://uwsgaming:[NEW_PASSWORD]@/uwsgaming?host=/cloudsql/uws-gaming:us-central1:uws-gaming-db`
- **Local**: `postgresql://uwsgaming:[NEW_PASSWORD]@34.63.231.8:5432/uwsgaming`

## Scripts Created

### Core Scripts
1. `simple-backup.ps1` - Backup current credentials
2. `simple-reset.ps1` - Reset database credentials
3. `test-connection.ps1` - Test database connections
4. `redeploy-services.ps1` - Redeploy Cloud Run services

### Usage Examples
```powershell
# Backup (already done)
.\simple-backup.ps1

# Reset credentials (already done)
.\simple-reset.ps1

# Test connections
.\test-connection.ps1 -Local
.\test-connection.ps1 -Production

# Redeploy services
.\redeploy-services.ps1
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Local Development
```powershell
# Navigate to your app directory
cd apps/frontend  # or apps/backend

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Start local development
npm run dev
```

### 2. Redeploy Production Services
```powershell
# Run the redeployment script
.\redeploy-services.ps1

# Or manually redeploy
gcloud run deploy krakengaming-backend --region=us-central1
gcloud run deploy krakengaming-frontend --region=us-central1
```

### 3. Test Production Deployment
- Visit your production domain
- Test login functionality
- Check application logs for any errors

### 4. Database Migrations (if needed)
```powershell
# If you have pending migrations
cd apps/frontend
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or from backend
cd apps/backend
npm run db:migrate
```

## Security Notes

✅ **Completed Security Improvements**:
- Generated cryptographically secure 32-character password
- Updated all secret references
- Maintained proper secret management practices
- Created backup of old credentials

⚠️ **Important**: 
- Old credentials are now invalid
- All services must be redeployed to use new credentials
- Local development requires the new `.env.local` file

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Local development works with new credentials
- [ ] Production services redeployed successfully  
- [ ] Database connections functional
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Application functionality verified
- [ ] No credential-related errors in logs

## Troubleshooting

### Local Development Issues
1. Check `.env.local` exists and has correct DATABASE_URL
2. Ensure your app reads from `.env.local`
3. Verify database connectivity from your network

### Production Issues
1. Check Cloud Run service environment variables
2. Verify secrets are properly mounted
3. Check Cloud SQL Proxy connections
4. Review application logs

### Connection Issues
1. Verify database instance is running
2. Check firewall rules for local connections
3. Ensure database user has proper permissions

## Rollback Plan (if needed)
If issues occur, you can restore from backup:
1. Navigate to `credential-backups/backup_2025-06-30_16-38-10/`
2. Restore secrets from backed up files
3. Restore environment files
4. Redeploy services with old credentials

**Backup Location**: `credential-backups/backup_2025-06-30_16-38-10/`
